# digiQuack
digiQuack is an easy DuckyScript to DigiSpark payload converter based on C++. It contains various features including full DuckyScript language support, execution limiter, DigiSpark memory optimizations and more. Note though that currently support of foreign keyboard layouts (not english ones is rather spotty, so try it out and see if it works out for yourself).

# Instructions
![screenshot](/images/screenshot.png)
Just download one of the releases or download the source (digiQuack.cpp) and compile it yourself.

>Linux/Mac OS users: use ./digiQuack in the terminal to run. Drag and drop the txt file with the payload you want to convert and follow the prompt.

>Windows users: Run the digiQuack.exe. Drag and drop the txt file with the payload you want to convert and follow the prompt.

The converted file will be placed in the scripts' directory and will be named converted.txt. You can then follow seytonic's tutorial (in the credits) to install it on your digispark.
